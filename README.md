# Pinkdeck Helper #
This script is a helper script I wrote for my Pinkdeck OBS controlling keyboard. It lets you change your game, stream title, and communities all in the press of a button!

## Setup ##
1. Create a file called `.pinkdeck.handles` in your AppData folder (`%APPDATA%\.pinkdeck.handles`) on windows, or the root of your user directory (`~/.pinkdeck.handles`) on OS X and Linux) based on the `example.pinkdeck.handles` file.
2. run `python setup.py install`.
3. Run the `pinkdeck` command.
4. Authorize the _Pinkdeck Helper_ application for your Twitch account (We require access to update your channel's information and to run commercials).
5. You should be done!

## I found an error! I want this feature! Help! ##
Submit an issue! I'm only really testing this on Windows because that's where I'm using it, but it should theoretically work on every platform. If it doesn't, tell me!
